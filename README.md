# Data-analysis
The idea of this work is to investigate the relationship between number of touristic departures and economic, social and environmental aspects and also see the connection to the happiness index. 
Here, I will show data analysis on examples of travel data, and economic indicators from the World Bank Indicators. I will also link the number of travel departures with the happiness index. 

I used the datasets from Kaggle.com: 
Tourism Demographics; World Bank Indicators and Happiness index data.

For the analysis, I used Python pandas and Matplotlib, and Seaborn for visualization.

The notebook: Int_tourism_demographics.ipynb was used for the investigation and plotting of the arrival and departure data worldwide.
In this step, I decided to continue the analysis on two countries: China and Russia, because their departures data show the most interesting trends. 
The notebooks are called: economy.ipynb, education.ipynb, health.ipynb, priv_sector_china.ipynb, public_sector_China.ipynb - investigate the World Bank Indicator data on economic, environmental and social aspects in China.
The notebooks called: economy_Russia.ipynb, education_RF.ipynb, health_RF.ipynb, priv_sector_RF.ipynb, public_sector_RF.ipynb - investigate the data for Russia.
The notebook: happiness connects a number of tourist departures and happiness index.

Before the use of all the datasets, the cleaning on the data was applied.
